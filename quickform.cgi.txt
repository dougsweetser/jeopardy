# I got really ticked when the form response programs I wanted to use
# all wanted to send me an e-mail. I don't want an email.
# So I wrote this VERY simply program to post the data to a logfile and
# redirect the user to a "form successful" page. That's all it does. Period.
# If you want a fancy form handler, go somewheres else, but I just
# wanted a simple script to post form data to a logfile
# Your form should have action=post
# For every input name on your form, you'll have to add it to the
# script below, and decide whether to make it required or not.
# Enjoy
# I'm not guilty or responsible if this screws up your system. It works 
# fine on mine.
